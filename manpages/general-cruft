.SH NAME
general-cruft -- Computer Cleanliness Report
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fB general-cruft\fP [\fB--mail\fP [\fIdestination\fP]]
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBgeneral-cruft\fP is a support utilitiy that combines the output of
debsums, cruft, and apt to inform you of the tidyiness of a machine.

Output is sent to standard output, unless \fB--mail\fP is provided,
in which case an email will be sent to the specified destination, or
root@localhost.

It reports:
.IP \[bu]
All manually installed apt packages
.IP \[bu]
All packages that be automatically removed
.IP \[bu]
All changed package and configuration files
.IP \[bu]
All files reported missing by cruft
.IP \[bu]
All broken symlinks and extrenuous files

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS

.TP
\fB--mail [destination]\fP
Send an email to \fB<destination>\fP (or, by default, <root@localhost>)
rather than reporting to standard output.
.SH REPORT FORMAT

The report is split into several sub reports based on the underlying tool
that is using them.
The first section is the checksums for all of the general-cruft files in
use, designed to check that cruft itself has not been modified.
This does not work as a security mechanism, but allows for cross-referencing
information over time or between machines.

After that, each section which generated information is output (with the
\fBcruft\fP(1) always having at least its section header).
